        <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          I am interested in IT as I believe it is the most stable future
          career, and is also a career that I can do while I travel.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My interest in IT began when we got the first family computer when I
          was 7 years old, and I spent HOURS playing Raymond and mucking around
          with the original Microsoft Suite. I then grew up using MSN and
          sprucing up my Bebo and MySpace accounts by altering the HTML coding.
          I let this interest slide by in favour of working in an industry that
          got me decent money at the time, but wish I had of stuck with it and
          made that my focus.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I chose to study with RMIT through OUA as it has a great reputation
          within Victoria, and I wish to study my full degree with RMIT once I
          decided what course to take and have enough credit built up. I believe
          that this introductory course is a great way to get back into study
          after 10 years, and also get a feel for how RMIT operates as well
          before jumping into a full-time course load.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          During this 3 month period I expect that the introductory course will
          be a great way of learning the fundamentals of Information Technology
          and also help me learn my strengths and weaknesses. Once this course
          is complete, I will then have a much better idea of what form of IT I
          would like to further study in as well.
