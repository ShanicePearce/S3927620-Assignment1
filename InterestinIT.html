            <h1>Interest in IT</h1>

            <p>
              I am interested in IT as I believe it is the most stable future career
              that will also allow me to be a mother. My interest in IT began when we
              got the first family computer when I was 7 years old, and I spent HOURS
              playing Raymond and mucking around with the original Microsoft Suite. I
              then grew up using MSN and sprucing up my Bebo and MySpace accounts by
              altering the HTML coding.
            </p>
            <p>
              I chose to study with RMIT through OUA as it has a great reputation within
              Victoria, and I wish to study my full degree with them once I decided what
              course to take. I believe that this introductory course is a great way to
              get back into study after 10 years, and also get a feel for how RMIT
              operates as well before jumping into a full-time course load.
            </p>
            <p>
              During this 3 month period I expect that the introductory course will be a
              great way of learning the fundamentals of Information Technology and also
              help me learn my strengths and weaknesses. Once this course is complete, I
              will then have a much better idea of what form of IT I would like to
              further study in as well.
