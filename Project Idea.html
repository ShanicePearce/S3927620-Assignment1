        <h2>Project Idea</h2>
        <br />
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          My project would be developing a mobile based application that will show what bottle shops and pubs are open around you based on either your current location (as a default) or the search location/suburb that you input. The application would use information that has been harvested from Google maps and use a traffic light system on their identifying pin drops to easily see their current status based on opening hours.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          My motivation for the creation of this app is to make it easier on a night out when you are looking for the next bar/pub/club to go to. It is also to identify bottle shops that are open if you are about to head out to a friends place, or if you are finished with work/going out and about to head home.
        </p>
        <br />
          <p>
            One of my favourite things to do is get together with friends for a drink at a local bar, or grab a few bottles of wine before going to their place. I am also an inherently lazy person, so I sometimes get frustrated with the clunky layout of Google maps when trying to locate an open venue, then having to click on it and read their open hours. This application help simplify this and save time.
          </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          ‘Cal’ would be first designed as a web-based application, once the demand is high enough it would then be developed into a native mobile app.
          </p>

          <p>The main feature of it would be the traffic light system. This would be as follows:</p>
          <br />
          <div class="red">
            <p>Red – Closed</p>
        </div>
          <br />
          <div class="amber">
          <p>Amber – Open, but will be closed in less than a hour</p>
        </div>
        <br />
          <div class="green">
            <p>Green – Open for the next hour or longer</p>
          </div>
          <br />
          <p>The traffic light system would be applied to the pin drop of each venue which would show up on the map. When you click onto a pin drop that you are interested in, a little dialogue box would pop out next to it showing some more details on that specific location.</p>
          <br />
          <p>This dialogue box will display the key information for that venue – business name, opening hours for that day, what that venue is (bottle shop, bar, pub or club) and the physical address.</p>
          <br />
          <p>If you wish to know more about the business, you will click on the business name within the box. This would then minimise the map display to a small portion at the top of the screen and more details for the selected venue would be displayed. </p>
          <br>
          <p>In this detailed section it would list the business name, opening hours across all days of the week and physical address. Below that it would then list the phone number, website, star rating based on reviews.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Once you have decided on where you want to go next you can click on the address within that business and it will open Google Maps. Google Maps will then give you all the usual options to get there, be it walking, driving (if under the limit) and public/rideshare options.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Tools and Technologies </h3>
          <p>To get this project up and off the ground I would need the below</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	-Registered domain</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -This is key as without a domain you cannot have a website</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Wireframe layout</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Having a Wireframe layout will help visualise the ideal layout and location of all website elements</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Access to Google Cloud Platform </p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-This is key for ‘Cal’ as it is the way that the locational data for all the bars/pubs/clubs will be loaded into the web app</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Visual Studio Code</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-For all the coding that will be required</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Skills Required </h3>
          <p>HTML and CSS is what would be primarily used for all the design required to get this website up and running. As a newbie to the tech world, a lot of the skills would be learnt on the go via watching YouTube videos and trial and error. Using Google Cloud Platforms would be a way to save on storage space and help with the deployment of the website once ready to launch.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Outcome </h3>
          <p>If my project is successful, it will help benefit all of the thirsty people that want to easily see where they can get their next drop. This web-based app would also help people be safer when out and about as they will not be aimlessly walking trying to find somewhere that is open. Instead, they can open Cal, see where that next amber or green pinpoint is, and walk there knowing that they are not going to get there and see a black bar/pub/club.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I can already picture Cal being the app that they turn to when they want to find where to go next. My end goal is for Cal to be on the same level as Dan Murphy's, in that everyone in Australia knows who Dan is and one day they will also know Cal.</p>
