        <h2>Project Idea - "Cal"</h2>
        <br />
        <h3>Motto - The next one is on Cal</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          My project would be developing a mobile based application that will
          show what bottle shops and pubs are open around you based on either
          your current location (as a default) or the search location/suburb
          that you input. The application would use information that has been
          harvested from Google maps and use a traffic light system on their
          identifying pin drops to easily see their current status based on
          opening hours.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My motivation for the creation of this app is to make it easier on a
          night out when you are looking for the next bar/pub/club to go to. It
          is also to identify bottle shops that are open if you are about to
          head out to a friends place, or if you are finished with work/going
          out and about to head home. One of my favourite things to do is get
          together with friends for a drink at a local bar, or grab a few
          bottles of wine before going to their place. I am also an inherently
          lazy person, so I sometimes get frustrated with the clunky layout of
          Google maps when trying to locate an open venue, then having to click
          on it and read their open hours. This application help simplify this
          and save time.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This application would be first designed as a mobile based
          application, as I believe that would be the main device people would
          use it on. The main feature of it would be the traffic light system. </p>
          <p>This would be as follows:</p>
          <br />
          <div class="red">
            <p>Red – Closed</p>
        </div>
          <br />
          <div class="amber">
          <p>Amber – Open, but will be closed in less than a hour</p>
        </div>
        <br />
          <div class="green">
            <p>Green – Open for the next hour or longer</p>
          </div>
          <br />
          <p>The traffic light system would be applied to the pin drop of each
          venue which would show up on the map. When you click onto a pin drop
          that you are interested in, a little dialogue box would pop out next
          to it showing some more details on that specific location.</p>
          <br />
          <p>This dialogue box will display the key information for that venue –
          business name, opening hours for that day, what that venue is (bottle
          shop, bar, pub or club) and the physical address.</p>
          <br />
          <p>If you wish to know more about the business, you would click on the
          business name within the box. This would then minimise the map display
          to a small portion at the top of the screen and more details for the
          selected venue would be displayed. In this detailed section it would
          list the business name, opening hours across all days of the week and
          physical address. Below that it would then list the phone number,
          website, star rating based on reviews.</p>
