          The above position is for a database specialist that can help with
          analysing data for multiple areas within the company. This role also
          calls for someone that can communicate well with others, and can also
          self-manage their workload. This role is appealing to me as I’m a very
          analytic person that loves the idea of working within a database
          management type career path.

          system

        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Linux and Windows
          Server
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-AWS (Amazon Web
          Services)
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Strong people skills with the ability to
          communicate with management and higher ups
        </p>
        <br />

          role are as below:
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Strong communication with the ability to

        <br />
        <p>
          The way I plan to gain better skills and qualifications to progress
          towards this career path is to do any free courses/certifications that
          I can with companies such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon (AWS). I am
          also looking into starting to do freelance work to broaden my skills
          within the IT sector (specifically within data input and database
          management), this will allow me to build up a portfolio of
          skills/experience while also allowing me to further my communication
          skills when dealing with a wide variety of people from different
          sectors.
