          <h3>Thoughts on the testing</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Looking at the above test results, I think that it reflects that I
            am a very goal driven person. Once I start a task, I always like to
            finish it to the best of my abilities.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I believe that these results show that in a team environment, I am
            more likely to be the person thinking about the plan and how to
            implement it. I’m not usually the person leading the conversation;
            however, I will be the person that make sure the task gets done to
            the best of our abilities.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            When forming a team, I don’t generally look at people’s
            personalities. I tend to more look at their proven body of work when
            possible, and if they can be respectful of other people’s opinions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            No one will ever 100% get along, but if they get the job done, I am
            happy. That could also just be me wanting to avoid conflict whenever
            possible.
          </p>
          <br />

              >When it comes to these personality tests, I don’t put a lot of
              weight behind them. As someone that has autism, I know firsthand
              that one test doesn't suit all. The idea of standardised testing
              to "See who someone is" doesn't sit well with me.
