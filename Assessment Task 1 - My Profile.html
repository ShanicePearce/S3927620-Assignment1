    <h2>Personal Information</h2>

    <p>
      I was born and raised in North Queensland, and lived there until 2019 when
      my partner and I decided to make the move to Victoria. My formal education
      to date is pretty basic, I completed up until Year 10 and then decided
      that full-time work suited me more. I have been working within the
      automotive/truck industry now for a decade, and while I love my work I am
      wanting to change careers before 30 so that I have better flexibility when
      having children. While I currently only speak English, I am very
      interested in learning to speak Korean :)
      <br />In my spare time I enjoy playing Metroidvaniaâ€”style video games and
      also building model figure (Gundam etc.). My partner and I will be
      adopting 2 greyhounds soon, and I cannot put into words how happy that
      will make me to have a pet again.
    </p>

    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>

    <p>
      I am interested in IT as I believe it is the most stable future career
      that will also allow me to be a mother. My interest in IT began when we
      got the first family computer when I was 7 years old, and I spent HOURS
      playing Raymond and mucking around with the original Microsoft Suite. I
      then grew up using MSN and sprucing up my Bebo and MySpace accounts by
      altering the HTML coding.
    </p>
    <p>
      I chose to study with RMIT through OUA as it has a great reputation within
      Victoria, and I wish to study my full degree with them once I decided what
      course to take. I believe that this introductory course is a great way to
      get back into study after 10 years, and also get a feel for how RMIT
      operates as well before jumping into a full-time course load.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this 3 month period I expect that the introductory course will be a
      great way of learning the fundamentals of Information Technology and also
      help me learn my strengths and weaknesses. Once this course is complete, I
      will then have a much better idea of what form of IT I would like to
      further study in as well.
    </p>
