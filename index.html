        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          I was born and raised in North Queensland, and lived there until 2019
          when my partner and I decided to make the move to Victoria. We are currently based in Shepparton, but hoping to move closer to Melbourne shortly to be closer to friends.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>My formal education to date is pretty basic, I completed up until Year 10 and
          then decided that full-time work suited me more. I have been working
          within the automotive/truck industry now for a decade, and while I
          love my work, I am wanting to change careers before 30 so that I have
          better flexibility in the future. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p> While I currently only speak
          English, I am very interested in learning Korean. Once the travel restrictions are over, South Korea is the first country my partner and I will visit.
          </p>
          <br />
         <p>In my spare time I enjoy playing Metroidvaniaâ€”style video games
          and also building model figure (Gundam etc.). My partner and I will be
          adopting 2 greyhounds soon, and I cannot put into words how happy that
          will make me to have a pet again.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I have quite a large family, I am the eldest with 3 brothers and 3 sisters that all live in Queensland. While I miss them all dearly, I am also looking forward to being the cool aunt that lives near the city during school holidays. </p>
